	<h2>
	  For introduction to the Bible, Christianity, and the Gospel
	</h2>
	<div id='intro'>
	  <p>
		Hi! Before you begin, make sure this is the right capsule for you. Choose this capsule if you have had little or no exposure to the Bible and are not at all familiar with basic Bible concepts and stories.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I would like to invite you to explore a capsule view of the Bible. Each day, you will read a passage from the Bible found in the lesson and an explanation of that passage&rsquo;s message. Since there is so much content in the Bible, I have tried to fill in the gaps between verses in the explanations. If you would like to read any of the verses in context, though, you will need a full Bible. You should use an internet Bible (e.g.<a href='https://www.biblegateway.com'>BibleGateway</a>) for this capsule so you can switch between translations.

		The Story Begins (Genesis)
	  </h3>
		<div class='lesson'>
		  <h4 class='lessonhead'>
			Genesis 1:1-2 &ndash; Creation
		  </h4>
		  <h5 class='verse'>
			<span class='vsnum'>1</span> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  <span class='vsnum'>2</span> The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.  (NLT)
		  </h5>
		  <p class='descrip'>
			As we begin our journey through the amazing Bible, it is important to start here. This sets up God&rsquo;s plan for the world which is explained by the Bible. First, it acknowledges <em>one, all-powerful, perfect God</em> who created everything. He reigns over everything forever and ever, has no equal, and is second to none. It is critical to lock this down and believe it fully to grasp the message of the Bible. After this verse, God creates everything in our world over a six-day period to fill &ldquo;the earth [which] was formless and empty.&rdquo; Over the first five days God created light, say, sea, land, plants, stars, and planets. On the sixth and final day, God created land animals and &ldquo;mankind in [His own] image.&rdquo; (Gen. 1:26b NIV&reg;) The first man and woman were Adam and Eve and they were given authority over all the creatures and plants. God affirmed that all his creation was perfect and rested on the seventh day.

			Genesis 3:1-6 &ndash; Fall
		  </h4>
		  <h5 class='verse'>
			<span class='vsnum'>1</span>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, &ldquo;Did God really say, &lsquo;You must not eat from any tree in the garden&rsquo;?&rdquo;  <span class='vsnum'>2</span>The woman said to the serpent, &ldquo;We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, <span class='vsnum'>3</span>but God did say, &lsquo;You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.&rsquo;&rdquo;  <span class='vsnum'>4</span>&ldquo;You will not certainly die,&rdquo; the serpent said to the woman.  <span class='vsnum'>5</span>&ldquo;For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.&rdquo;  <span class='vsnum'>6</span>When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it.  She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.  (NIV&reg;)
		  </h5>
		  <p class='descrip'>
			All of God&rsquo;s creation was perfect, and humans ruled over God&rsquo;s creation with free will. Adam and Eve lived in a perfect world with almost no boundaries. Almost. God knew that their life would be better if they followed one simple instruction: &ldquo;but you must not eat fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will surely die.&rdquo; (Gen. 2:17, referenced again 3:3) One tree, in the middle of plants beyond imagination, was prohibited and yet, Adam and Eve managed to want more. That one rebellious act called sin against the ultimate, holy God resulted in every bad, evil, unpleasant, hurtful, damaging, destructive, troubling, imperfect thing in our world. Worst of all, the ultimate penalty for sin would now have to be inflicted: death.

			Genesis 22:15-18 &ndash; Promise
		  </h4>
		  <h5 class='verse'>
			<span class='vsnum'>15</span>Then the angel of the LORD called again to Abraham from heaven.  <span class='vsnum'>16</span> &ldquo;This is what the LORD says: Because you have obeyed me and have not withheld even your son, your only son, I swear by my own name that <span class='vsnum'>17</span> I will certainly bless you.  I will multiply your descendants beyond number, like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore.  Your descendants will conquer the cities of their enemies.  <span class='vsnum'>18</span>And through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed&mdash;all because you have obeyed me.&rdquo;  (NLT)
		  </h5>
		  <p class='descrip'>
			We now learn about a man named Abraham many years since the fall of mankind. Earlier, Abraham was promised a great nation from his offspring if they set off into the wilderness and follow God. Abraham and his wife were shocked &ndash; especially since they were far beyond that stage of their life and have no children. They struggle for years to trust God as they follow God through what is now the desert and wait for the child God promised. Finally, the promised baby is born and named Isaac when Abraham is one-hundred years old! God then tells Abraham to sacrifice this child &ndash; who Abraham waited for twenty-five years for &ndash; as an offering. (God is not really this cruel, this is only God testing Abraham as it says in verse one.) Abraham has finally learned to have faith in God and agrees to God's request regardless of how hard it must have been to do so. With Isaac prepared for sacrifice, God stops Abraham, knowing that Abraham is willing to trust God through anything. God offers Abraham a ram to sacrifice instead, and Abraham passes the test of faith. Amazingly, God tells Abraham that from his family line would come a great nation that would eventually bless and save the entire world through one man: The Messiah (Promised One).

		The Promise Fulfilled (Gospels)
	  </h3>
		<div class='lesson'>
		  <h4 class='lessonhead'>
			Luke 1:29-33 &ndash; Proclamation
		  </h4>
		  <h5 class='verse'>
			<span class='vsnum'>29</span>Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.  <span class='vsnum'>30</span>But the angel said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God.  <span class='vsnum'>31</span>You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus.  <span class='vsnum'>32</span>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.  The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, <span class='vsnum'>33</span>and he will reign over Jacob&apos;s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.&rdquo;  (NIV&reg;)
		  </h5>
		  <p class='descrip'>
			It has been over 400 years since the nation of Judah has heard from God in any way, shape, or form. Jacob came after Abraham and Isaac, and the nation promised in the last lesson was birthed from Jacob. Well, sort of. They started as slaves in Egypt to escape famine and waited hundreds of years for God to rescue them through Moses. That began millennia of ups in downs in following God. Way too much happened to explain here, but now the nation has been through a split, exile, and rebirth to get here. Now, the nation is under Roman oppression and occupation. Many are tired of the Romans and are looking forward to the promised Messiah as hope. In such a time, this proclamation is huge. The Savior and Messiah &ndash; Christ &ndash; is coming! This man would come to fulfill a prophecy thousands of years old. Most important of all, this child would come to save the whole world from the clutch of the enemy, death, and sin for eternity.

			Matthew 27:50-53 &ndash; Over
		  </h4>
		  <h5 class='verse'>
			<span class='vsnum'>50</span>And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.  <span class='vsnum'>51</span>At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.  The earth shook, the rocks split <span class='vsnum'>52</span>and the tombs broke open.  The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.  <span class='vsnum'>53</span>They came out of the tombs after Jesus&rsquo; resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared to many people.  (NIV&reg;)
		  </h5>
		  <p class='descrip'>
		  This Jesus has come to be the Savior of the world as we know from earlier. At about the age of thirty, Jesus was publicly identified as God&rsquo;s Son by none other than God Himself (see Matthew 3:13-17). He started a successful ministry that lasted for three and a half years and has many followers including a group of 12 specific disciples. But now, the man who so many knew as the Messiah has been arrested, tried, and sentenced to crucifixion!?!? Crucifixion was the most painful, most shameful way to die, and only the absolute worst criminals were executed this way. This leaves his followers both baffled and devastated; you may be confused, too. After sin entered the world, all were condemned to die (&ldquo;For the wages of sin is death&rdquo; &ndash;Romans 6:23a NIV&reg;) unless a sufficient sacrifice was made. These sacrifices died in place of the sinful human. Before Jesus, animal sacrifices would make temporary atonement (i.e. payment) for the sins of God&rsquo;s holy nation, the Israelites, and anyone who would turn to the true God. Now, God sent Jesus as the God-man to permanently wipe out our sins as the ultimate sacrifice by dying even though he never sinned. More simply stated, Jesus never rebelled against God like we often do by doing acts that go against God&rsquo;s commands, but he still took the penalty of our rebellious acts upon himself so that God looks at us the way we were before the fall of mankind.

			Luke 24:5-8 &ndash; Alive
		  </h4>
		  <h5 class='verse'>
			<span class='vsnum'>5</span> So the women were terrified and bowed down to the ground. &ldquo;Why are you looking for the living among the dead?&rdquo; asked the men.  <span class='vsnum'>6</span> &ldquo;He is not here, but He has been resurrected!  Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee, <span class='vsnum'>7</span> saying, &lsquo;The Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, be crucified, and rise on the third day&rsquo;?&rdquo;  <span class='vsnum'>8</span> And they remembered His words.  (HCSB)
		  </h5>
		  <p class='descrip'>
		  To fully understand this passage, you should think like one of these women who had come to Jesus&rsquo;s tomb. Imagine that the man who you have trusted as the Savior of your life, the one you have expected to conquer evil, has died three days ago as a Roman criminal even though he had done nothing wrong. Some quick background knowledge: in that time, a common belief was that the spirit left a dead body on the third day. Therefore, Jesus would be as good as gone. But the women had forgotten that this Jesus had told them that he would have to die and then live again. And that the Savior&rsquo;s death had been predicted before Jesus was even born. And that Jesus had raised His friend Lazarus from the dead after three days had passed beforehand. If He could raise Lazarus from the dead, why couldn&rsquo;t He overcome His own death? Anyway, you &ndash; as one of the people coming to see Jesus &ndash; enter the tomb with the stone that had been sealing the tomb rolled away (Weren&rsquo;t there Roman Guards here before? you ask) and discover that Jesus is missing. Then you see two men in glowing clothes that tell you that Jesus is alive! Jesus has conquered death by coming as a servant to mankind and suffering like the prophets had prophesied. Because of this, those who believe in Jesus may physically die, but their spirit will exist forever in heaven after their life on earth.

			<span class='vsnum'>16</span>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. <span class='vsnum'>17</span>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.

		  Often known as the most quoted verse in the Bible, John 3:16 about sums it up.  The gospel, which means good news, is the term used by Christians everywhere to define what Jesus did for us and what it means for those who believe.  It is more like miraculous, marvelous, incredible, wonderful, overwhelming, staggering, astonishing news.  We sinned and rebelled.  He loved us anyway.  We denied and turned away.  He never gave up chasing us.  We crucified our Savior.  He rose again to save us.  I cannot say it any better than this verse.  There is one critical point to talk about, though.  Jesus freely surrendered His life for everyone.  John 3:16b says: “whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” (NIV®, emphasis mine) That means that you, along with anyone else, can have everlasting life in heaven by simply believing with all your heart that Jesus is God, was killed in your place, rose from the grave, and conquered our sins and death forever.  Surrender your life to Him, and Jesus will cover and erase your sins.  The family of God will adopt you and give you the ultimate inheritance.  If you want to be part of this miracle, stop right now and go to our <a href='gospel/default.html'>Road to Salvation Capsule</a>.  Your time on earth is limited, so do not wait.  Enter the family of God today.

			Acts 1:8-10 &ndash; Commission
		  </h4>
		  <h5 class='verse'>
			<span class='vsnum'>8</span>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&rdquo; <span class='vsnum'>9</span>After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight. <span class='vsnum'>10</span>They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. (NIV&reg;)
		  </h5>

		  Jesus does not stick around for long. After a mere 40 days since His resurrection, He gives a mysterious command that hints at a special power and spreading the message of Christ to the world. The disciples and close friends who were with Jesus were expecting Jesus to fulfill the Jewish dreams of a conquering Messiah. They will not realize until later what we already know; the Savior must suffer before coming again to abolish evil. Jesus will come back the same way (Acts 1:11) to finally wipe the world clean of our sin. This passage, the Great Commission, is the calling of every Christian. The Holy Spirit is God who lives inside us and influences, empowers, and helps us. When you are saved by Christ, the Holy Spirit enters you and enables you to do amazing things through God&rsquo;s power when He allows. Christians should be actively on a mission to spread the good news of Jesus Christ doing remarkable things through the power of the Holy Spirit. After this, the Holy Spirit first comes to the believers on the Day of Pentecost, and the church grows from there rapidly. The gospel spreads rapidly, and thousands at a time are saved. The church becomes the central way for Christians to connect and strengthen each other in their faith. Church attendance is important for new believers to develop you as a Christian, or a church can guide you through the salvation process if you need guidance. Some churches, though, do not teach the truth about Him. Most importantly, check everything you are taught against the Scriptures and reject any and all teaching that does not agree with the Holy Bible.

			<span class='vsnum'>1</span> Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away (vanished), and there is no longer any sea.  <span class='vsnum'>2</span> And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, arrayed like a bride adorned for her husband;  
			<span class='vsnum'>3</span> and then I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, &ldquo;See!

          After all that has happened in the world, we arrive here. Revelation is the recording of a vision that showed how the world would end. This specific passage details the amazing new world in store for those who have been saved. It is hard to imagine such an amazing universe to live in, so I cannot describe it much better. Instead of an in-depth description, I would like you to read this passage a few more times until you fully realize the awe-inspiring world described here. If you are ready to join those who will be here for eternity, Jesus is ready to forgive you. For some guidance, <a href='gospel/default.html'>click here</a>.

          Amen, indeed. He will come back in a glorious return we will talk more about later. The amazing story of salvation that we have explored is not even close to the whole Bible and there is so much more to explore. Still, this is the end of our first capsule. The story does not stop here. The key is that you join in on the gift Jesus has given us and continue reading the Bible. You can choose to continue exploring the storyline of the Bible in <a href='capsule2/default.html'>Capsule 2</a> and beyond by going back to our <a href='http://tencapsule.com'>homepage</a>. If you are ready to accept the gift of salvation, go to our <a href='gospel/default.html'>Road to Salvation Capsule</a>. Thank you for joining me on this journey of exploration, and I hope that you continue with our further capsules. Goodbye for now!
