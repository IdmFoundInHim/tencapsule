      Capsule 3
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Covers the history of the Ancient Israelites from Abraham to Nehemiah
    </h2>
    <div class='intro'>
      <p>Welcome to the third capsule! You should have a basic knowledge of the Bible – including Creation, the Fall, the 10 Commandments, Jesus, and the New Heaven and Earth – before you begin this capsule. This capsule will need you to read twenty chapters of the Bible, and I will help you understand the passage through a brief explanation. Thousands of years ago, God chose a certain man named Abraham and called Abraham to follow God. God promised Abraham fertile land and a great nation from his offspring; God would reveal Himself to the world and save everyone from their sins through that nation. However, the nation would go through many difficulties in their relationship with God.</p>

        <h4 class='lessonhead'>Genesis 12, 22</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+12&version=NIV">Go to Genesis 12</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Abram is living the high life.  He is surrounded by wealth and luxury.  He is safe and comfortable at age 75.  Anyone in that position would need a radical reason to leave that behind and adventure through the wilderness.  Abram and his wife did lack one thing: children.  This had weighty consequences for him in ancient times.  Having a child would raise his social status and keep his legacy alive.  God promised Abram a better life – prime land, fame, and a magnificent nation from His children – if Abram would follow God away from Haran.  Abram’s family and neighbors worshipped many false gods and idols (Joshua 24:2), so Abram would also be giving up the religion that surrounded him.  Abram now must choose to live an easy, self-centered life or be a blessing to the whole earth.  In a comparable way, God offers us a choice between following Him into eternal life or abandoning Him for our own ways in this life.
        </p>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Abram does follow God, but this is no easy feat.  Since having a baby at 75 is miraculous, Abram must trust God to deliver on His promises.  God explains that Abram’s descendants would take over the land of Canaan in the modern-day Middle East.  The people in Canaan at that time were evil and dishonored God, so He was turning going to turn that corrupt place into His holy (set apart) land.  Abram devotes himself to God, giving Him worship and thanks.  However, a famine forces Abram to go to Egypt to get food. Fearing for His life, he lies and ignores God’s promises while in Egypt.  Still, God does not give up on Abram and continues to provide for him.  These back-to-back events show God’s mercy – that is, not giving us the punishment we deserve – and foreshadows what will happen with both the nation God has promised and all Christians:  We all go through times when we are devoted to God and times when we ignore God, but He stays with us and gives us mercy, forgiving us when we refocus on him.
        </p>
        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen+22&version=NIV">Go to Genesis 22</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          It was twenty-five years before Abram/Abraham saw a son of his own as God had promised.  Abraham endured difficult events including leaving a family member, failing to trust God, and having his name changed God Himself.  Now, Isaac – Abraham’s son – is growing up, and God has a final test for Abraham.  Finally, Abraham seems to have learned that God’s solution is the perfect one.  His faith – confident trust in what cannot be seen – has been developed by tough times and seeking God.  This test also proves Isaac’s faith as he <em>willingly and knowingly</em> allows Abraham to follow God’s plan.  As a teenager, Isaac would have known about sacrifices to God but trusted his father and God to have his best interests in mind.
        </p>
        <p class='descrip'>
          This story lays the foundation for our salvation.  Redemption (being accepted by God after being separated from Him) needs sacrifice and faith to be complete.  God was not planning on letting Abraham kill his son.  God has offered a substitute to sacrifice for our sins as He does in this story.  We should be the sacrifice, just like Isaac, but God provides a different option.  Abraham and Isaac’s faith mirror the greater sacrifice of God and Jesus.  Both fathers send their only son to be sacrificed, both sons willingly go, and God gives a substitute in both instances.  Abraham’s faith has rewards: God blesses Abraham with a promise of countless offspring and considers Abraham to be an example of solid faith.  Our faith in Jesus allows us to have eternal life in paradise.

        <h4 class='lessonhead'>Exodus 11, 12</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex+11&version=NIV">Go to Exodus 11</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Radical events are forming the nation God promised.  Isaac had two children, but only one – Jacob, who would become Israel – followed God and became the head of the promised nation.  Jacob’s twelve sons are the fathers of the twelve tribes of Israel.  Because of a famine, they all live in Egypt for 400 years and prosper, growing to around two million people!  Ancient Egypt, as a world power, feels threatened by the growing family of Israel.  Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, intends to stop their growth and enslaves the Israelites, but God raises up a leader named Moses who demands that Pharaoh let the Israelites leave Egypt and set up an independent nation.  Pharaoh refuses to free the Israelites, so God sends a little help:  A series of ten plagues, each one a national crisis, punish Egypt for abusing God’s people and ignoring the One, True God.  Exodus 11 records the last, worst plague that convinces Pharaoh to free the Israelites.
        </p>
        <p class='descrip'>
          There are two main reasons that God sent the plagues on Egypt: First, God was showing His power to the Israelites and the Egyptians.  He is convincing everyone that He is in total control.  If the people of Israel doubt God’s help, why would they follow Him out of Egypt?  If the people of Egypt doubt God’s punishment, why would they let their slaves go free?  God swiftly answers these doubts with the ten plagues.  Second, God is showing that He is the only real God.  The people of Egypt give up time and possessions to worshipping statues as if they were God.  Each of the plagues is a crisis that one of the false gods is supposed to prevent, showing how powerless they are.  The God who chose the Israelites is God over everything and has no equal.  God will not allow His authority as God to be mocked and ignored forever.  All the firstborn children in Egypt die for the nation’s evil behavior, and the Egyptians give all their valuables away to the Israelites in response to God’s power and influence.  Through these punishments, God supplies freedom and resources for the Israelites.  The people of Canaan, the place where the Israelites will settle, also worship false gods.  God will rid the earth of the evil people of Canaan as punishment and give the land to the Israelites.
        </p>
        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex+12&version=NIV">Go to Exodus 12</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          God is rescuing the Israelites and wants all Israelites, including those born after the Exodus, to remember and know about His deliverance.  Therefore, He decrees the holiday of Passover, in which all Jews relive these events through specific symbols.  The ceremony shows how quickly the Israelites had to leave.  The Jews eat with their shoes on, are dressed to leave, keep no leftovers, and use the fastest ways to cook food.  The celebration of the Passover demands the sacrifice of a perfect lamb with no broken bones in obedience to God.  Even the bitter herbs remind the Israelites to never forget their bitter life of slavery before God’s deliverance.
        </p>
        <p class='descrip'>
          About 15 centuries later, Jesus would die during the Passover celebration.  God designed Passover to mirror Jesus’s death and support his identity as the Messiah.  Jesus was the perfect sacrifice that saves us from eternal death.  Jesus died <em>more quickly</em> than normal and did not have his bones broken (John 19:33) – which was normally done during crucifixion.  Finally, Jesus rescues us from the bitterness of hell and delivers us to a new life in Heaven.  Those outside the Jewish family line could accept Passover and all the Jewish traditions and receive God's blessings that he promised for the Israelites.  God gave outsiders the opportunity to devote their lives to Him and be saved through His promises for the Israelites.  God gave plenty of signs to the world that the Jewish nation knew the source of deliverance from sin’s problems.  At the same time, He showed that anyone could accept that salvation as their own by following the True God.  Jesus’s sacrifice made a way for anyone to be saved by simply trusting Him as God.

        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev+26&version=NIV">Go to Leviticus 26</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          The promised nation is born, and God presents them with a choice.  They can follow Him and gain blessings of abundance, safety, peace, and a relationship with God, making their world very much like the Garden of Eden in Gen 1 and 2.  If they turn away from God, they will be vulnerable to anxiety, fear, and invasion.  At that point, they are given the choice to turn back to God and get a second chance.  If they continue to disobey, famine and drought will come upon them.  The third wave will bring animal attacks and a severe shortage of food, and in the fourth wave the Israelites will be oppressed, controlled by foreigners, consumed by chaos, resorting to cannibalism, and left in ruins.  No matter how much the Israelites sin and disobey, God is still willing to restore the blessings if the nation turns back to Him.  In any case, God may scatter the Israelites, but will never totally destroy them.  In 70 A.D. (C.E.), only decades after Jesus lived, Israel ceased to exist as a nation (<a href='https://www.britannica.com/event/Siege-of-Jerusalem-70'>more info here</a>) for over 1800 years.  On May 14, 1948, Israel became an official world nation once more, and many Jews have returned to the land they were promised.  The reuniting of Israel is a significant event in God’s plan for redeeming the world once and for all, and is a testament to God’s unfailing faithfulness and promise-keeping</p>

        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Joshua+11&version=NIV">Go to Joshua 11</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          We all love the underdog.  Countless stories are based on the success of some person or group of people who had no hope.  God loves the underdog Israel, too.  Israel, a puny, irrelevant nation, is about to conquer all the great nations of Canaan.  Nobody expected a throng of wandering people to destroy such grand armies.  If Israel was alone, that would be true.  A sizable army would quickly eliminate the Israelites.  God is the driving force that allows them to win against horrible odds.  God will use Israel the underdog to punish the nations of Canaan for their disgusting lack of morals and reverence for the Creator of the universe.  Soon, Israel destroys the huge army that protected the nations of Canaan.  Finally, God’s people have arrived in the land which God promised to give them.  He is the only one responsible for the victory.  Canaan is His gift to Israel.

        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+1&version=NIV">Go to Judges 1</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Israel is doing well.  God has used His power to clear the way for His people to enter Canaan and prosper.  The Israelites, though, decide to quit while they are succeeding and force the remaining (fearful) people to work as laborers.  It sounds like a sensible plan, but God commanded the Israelites to wipe out all the people who did not worship Him.   The entire book of Judges tells how the native people tempt the Israelites to turn away from God.  Unfortunately, they succeed in making the Israelites give up their whole belief system.  “Everyone did as they saw fit.”  Judges delivers this poignant statement twice (17:6 and 21:25) and records how this causes everything in Israel to fall apart.  The blessings of the promise are temporarily removed, and Israel enters into a dark time.

        <h4 class='lessonhead'>1 Samuel 10, 15</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Sam+10&version=NIV">Go to 1 Samuel 10</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Since everything has fallen apart, the people want a king.  God wanted Israel to be different with Him as their only ruler.  No human could be perfect like God is, and an imperfect king would lead to an imperfect country.  Nevertheless, God is willing to use a monarchy for His plan.  He had known that Israel would eventually want a king and planned to give them one (Deuteronomy 17:14-20).  God is using Samuel to lead Israel as God’s representative, so Samuel will be the one to choose the new king at God’s instruction.  A boy named Saul goes to see Samuel for help finding donkeys.  Saul is unaware that a king is about to be selected but God has decided Saul should be the first king.  Samuel blesses Saul by God’s command.  Saul already appears fit to be king since he is tall, imposing, and strong.  God’s Spirit enters Saul and makes him a different person, so Saul suddenly becomes able to prophesy.  It may look different, but the main event is the same when people accept Christ as their Savior.  The Holy Spirit enters them and makes them a new person with added talents (not necessarily prophecy) to be used in God’s plan.  God uses each person differently and in His own time, so it is not always possible to see the change right away.  When Saul is publicly declared king, Samuel writes out God’s conditions for the king’s authority under God.  This acts as a constitution (it limits the king’s power) and makes it clear that God is the true ruler.
        </p>
        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Sam+15&version=NIV">Go to 1 Samuel 15</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          God intends to punish the Amalekites for their evil.  Just like Joshua’s military campaigns, Israel will destroy the whole nation by God’s command and might.  Saul is leading the military, and God gives Saul strict instructions.  Israel is victorious, but Saul does not completely follow God’s instructions.  God cannot have a leader who compromises instructions since the people of Israel follow the king, so God rejects and takes away the kingship of Saul.  Due to Saul’s continued failures, the nation of Israel becomes dominated by the military of another nation, the Philistines.
        </p>
        <p class='descrip'>
          God did not choose the wrong person to be king, although it may seem that way.  He is omniscient, which means He knows everything and makes the perfect choice in all situations.  His plan is the best one in the end, even when it seems like He was dead wrong.  He even makes certain choices just to teach His followers a crucial lesson.  The tragedy of King Saul shows us that – when we are making decisions – the choice that appears to be right is not always the correct choice.  God created us with the ability to make right or wrong decisions even though He knew we were going to fail and would need Him to save us.  He is God, and His creation shows His infinite glory and greatness.  We are in no position to accuse God of being wrong since He is the ruler and creator of the universe.  However, when we think things go wrong, God is willing to listen to our questions and will answer them as much as we can understand and are willing to listen.

        <p class='descrip'>
          Because Saul proved to be an ungodly king, a new king will replace Saul.  Samuel will select the new king that God wants.  God chooses the king differently than a typical person would.  He does not care about appearance.  He cares about a person’s relationship with Him.  Saul may have been intimidating, but he was not successful when he believed that he could work alone.  David instead sought God and humbled himself to focus on the ultimate King.  David’s own family excluded him, but God pursued the one who stayed true to Him.  Again, we see God’s spirit changing and blessing David when it enters him.  Now, God allows an evil spirit to torment Saul as punishment.  God’s gifts put David in a position where the king and kingdom favor David.  The work of God’s Spirit always carries out His plan.
        </p>
        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Sam+17&version=NIV">Go to 1 Samuel 17</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          The Philistines are at war with Israel.  Saul is still the official king but is trying to rule without God.  This causes a problem since Israel is reliant on God to survive.  Apart from God, they cannot protect themselves.  The Philistines do not trust God but have an intimidating weapon named Goliath.  Goliath is terrifying.  He is over nine feet tall, has top-of-the-line equipment, and can crush the enemy’s confidence with his jeering words.  Goliath is already champion since nobody is willing to fight him.  With fear as his weapon, he immobilizes the Israelite army and their inadequate leader.  All seems hopeless until David shows up.  God has promised Israel protection if they trust God, and David knows that he will live to be king because of God’s promise to him.  David has even seen God’s protection when David has fought wild animals to save his sheep.  Goliath has mocked God, and God will show up through David to prove His mighty presence.  </p>
        <p class='descrip'>
          God has a perfect plan.  If you just trust Him, you can live with joy, peace, and confidence.  David was seen as just another untalented teenager.  He was an ordinary shepherd, yet God made David influential, a warrior, and the ruler of the most important nation in ancient history.  Soon, Saul will die in battle, and David will take His place as king.

        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+17&version=NIV">Go to 2 Kings 17</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          David was an excellent king over the entire nation of Israel, the best it ever had.  He trusted God, so the Israelites followed God.  Even when he did make huge mistakes, he came back to God and humbly asked for forgiveness, which God gave David.  God blessed David’s reign and made it a great time to be an Israelite.  After David ruled his son Solomon, who was noble enough to turn down worldly blessings from God for wisdom.  But Solomon eventually changed for the worse and ignored God.  The consequences were civil war and a divided nation.  The whole nation of Israel split into two countries.  The northern kingdom was named Israel, and the southern kingdom was named Judah.  This is obnoxiously confusing.  When reading the Bible, you must use context to determine if ‘Israel’ refers to the original people group (including both the kingdom Israel and the kingdom Judah, based on family lines) or the kingdom (just the kingdom Israel, based on political boundaries).  Also, both names can also be names of people, as in Genesis and in genealogies.
        </p>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Evil, ungodly kings ruled Israel through its entire history.  The kings’ poor leadership led the people to break God’s commandments and worship false gods.  The people of Israel and Judah were supposed to be a special nation that worshipped God only.  They had only been successful because God took their small beginnings and made them great.  Without God, they were reduced to a doormat waiting to be stepped on.  When the weak nation went up against an empire, the kingdom of Israel was conquered.  From the time they turned away from God, they were doomed.  Assyria destroyed the kingdom of Israel as God’s punishment for their sins.  Most of God’s people are now in exile, and foreigners are in most of the Promised Land.  All that is left of the Promised Nation is the kingdom of Judah.
        </p>
        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+25&version=NIV">Go to 2 Kings 25</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Judah had a mix of good and bad kings.  (i.e. Some followed God, many did not.)  They watched the kingdom of Israel be punished yet continued to do evil.  In the end, Babylon would deliver God’s punishment on Judah.  Assyria and Babylon were not followers of God or better than Israel.  They did not even worship God, but He used those nations to keep His plan going.  All of God’s chosen people are now in exile – living in other countries and under the control of foreign leaders.  Their cities are plundered and burned.  The consequences of not following God are always horrible.  The Bible explains the punishments that Israel and Judah received.  For anyone who does not trust Jesus as their Savior, the punishment is worse: having to live apart from God for eternity.
        </p>
        <p class='descrip'>
          God, however, does not break His promises.  Some Jews still follow God during the exile as we will see in Daniel.  From this faithful remnant, a small group following God, He will restore Israel.  Instead of dying off, the nation of Judah will be reformed.  They will come back as a group devoted to God’s commands and will never turn away from God to worship false gods.  They will, however, develop a different problem.  Instead of focusing on God, they begin to focus only on the Law, missing its true purpose of revealing Him.  Consequently, Israel will not escape domination by other countries until after the Messiah comes.  The nation of Israel will be destroyed and the people scattered when Romans crush a Jewish rebellion against the Roman empire, but not before Jesus comes to fulfill the role of the Promised Savior.  Considering modern events, God’s chosen people have come together again in the modern nation of Israel.  Sadly, many have missed the fact that the Promised Messiah has already come and promises deliverance from the problems of the world and sin.

        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan+1&version=NIV">Go to Daniel 1</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          The Babylonians specialize in brainwashing.  They take the smartest, most attractive teenage boys from Israel and force them to accept Babylonian names, food, teachings, and religion. It now seems like God has abandoned the Israelites, and Daniel is surrounded by a culture soaked in false religion.  He is immediately presented with a critical choice that tests his dedication to God.  The ‘choice food’ offered to Daniel has been sacrificed to idols (and, as a result, is dishonoring to God).  But the food is delicious, and Daniel is expected to eat it.  Refusing to eat the food could mean Daniel would be punished by the king.  Daniel and his friends humbly ask permission to eat other food, and the only acceptable food around is strictly vegetarian.  There was nothing special about the vegetarian diet; it was the refusal to break the Jewish law, given by God, that was important.  Their confidence persuades their boss to give them vegetables to eat as an experiment.  God honors the dedication of Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah by improving their health and talents past all the other officials in Babylon.  The theme here is that remaining true to God will result in Him providing for your needs even when it does not seem possible.  Daniel and his friends became healthier and smarter than everyone else because they followed and honored God even more than the earthly king.

        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan+3&version=NIV">Go to Daniel 3</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          This story is widely known among Christians.  It is often called Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and/or the Fiery Furnace.  The king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, is prideful and pompous.  He creates a law that everyone must worship a statue of himself.  Nobody is going to oppose the king of the most powerful empire of the time.  Except for the followers of the One True God.  For some reason, Daniel is not here; he may have been on an extended business trip.  His friends pick up the slack by obeying God’s commands over the king’s.  It happens that King Nebuchadnezzar hears that he has rebellious subjects, gets mad, and throws the three into a blazing furnace.  God makes a statement to the prideful king, saving the three from a fiery demise.  Even today God has not stopped delivering His followers from persecution in many ways.  An important note to put here is that God does not always save followers from death and suffering for their faith.  He does promise that those who do suffer for their faith will receive extra rewards in heaven.  I will discuss this later in our study of Jesus and Christian living.

        <h5 class='verse'><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dan+7&version=NIV">Go to Daniel 7</a></h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Daniel now gets his opportunity to show his dedication to God.  Daniel continues to succeed because God is with him.  Others who do not know God are jealous of the success Daniel has.  They manipulate the king to punish Daniel for his faith in the One True God because Daniel is not corrupt in any way.  Consider that.  If somebody were to examine every part of your life, would they be unable to find a way to ruin your credibility?  Through the manipulation, the king brashly creates a law prohibiting Daniel to pray to God, unwillingly allowing Daniel to be arrested and thrown to his death in the lion’s den.  Daniel remains faithful to God, and God rewards him for remaining faithful.  For us, God may provide a rescue on earth or may not.  Following God should be our top priority either way since we know we will end up in heaven and be rewarded there for eternity.

          In a way, the four devoted exiles – Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego – are the opposite of the many ungodly kings of Israel and Judah.  Both had a position in government.  One group was in a God-centered society yet ignored God and turned to a false religion.  The other group was in a society that mocked God, but the exiles followed God at all costs.  We have to remember that God reaches out to everybody and is not limited by circumstances.  He controls the circumstances.  We will not be able to use our bad situations as excuses for not following God.  In a world that is continuing to collectively walk away from God, Christians must be completely willing to follow God no matter what the penalty may be.

          Why would a powerful king like Cyrus condescend enough to help the Jewish exiles?  God is the only one who could have changed Cyrus’s mind to show generosity to the Jews.  Cyrus likely expected to strengthen his empire in some way by letting the Israelites return to the Promised Land.  As believers, we should be also showing extreme generosity with what we have been given, but our motives are different.  God has given us everything we have, so we can use it to help others without expecting a return on earth.  When you develop a relationship with God, you will desire to love others like Jesus did.  We will have a loving, giving heart because we are thankful for Christ’s love, and the Holy Spirit will enable you to act in ways that reflect Jesus.

          God is delivering on His promise by using His power and influence to work events for the good of the Jews.  In the same way, Romans 8:28 tells us that God controls everything for the benefit of believers.  We can be sure that demanding times make us grow as people and followers of God.  The Jews will now get another chance to follow God, and – although they will not worship idols – they will be far from perfect.

          Finally, the Israelites are unified in Jerusalem.  When God’s people come together, they can bring restoration and new life.  This serves as an example of how the church works together.  The Jews rebuild the temple together; Christians who gather together can further God’s plans.  The Jews are fully dedicated to God regardless of everyone around them (Ezra 3:3) and try to follow God’s ordinances.  This is another reason Christians gather: to support each other and encourage each other through daily life.  Together, they give thanks and worship to God (3:11) as Christian gatherings do today.  There is a combination of joy and weeping since the new temple is a humble, inferior reflection of the days of the first temple.  We also can weep with each other as we go through hardship, but our circumstances should not consume us.  We can have joy – satisfaction knowing that eternity will be better since we are saved and works everything for our good.  Together, the Jews are noticed by many people as Ezra 3:13b explains, and a functioning church body shows Jesus and His gospel to the world.

        <p class='descrip'>
          The Israelites, dedicated to keeping God’s commands, gather together again to study the Law.  When they hear what they need to do, they act upon it immediately (see 8:13-18) by setting aside their lives and worshipping God.  When the people feel guilty, they weep with sadness, but God’s mercy comforts them and frees them from shame.  Their new knowledge of God brings them joy in vs. 10-12.  We should also read and study God’s Word.  The Holy Spirit will give us the wisdom to choose between good and evil.  He will also prompt us to change our ways to good, and God will comfort you with His mercy.

          As soon as the Israelites return to their home, they celebrate the Festival of Booths/Tabernacles.  This is fitting since the festival symbolizes 40 years of wandering which were the punishment for not trusting God in Exodus.  The Israelites were in exile for 40 years before being able to return to the promised land again.  But at the same time, the Festival of Tabernacles is about God delivering the Israelites through the desert.  The Israelites are reminded to trust Him for deliverance at all times.  Since no Jew will be able to perfectly follow God, Jesus will eventually come to deliver everybody who will simply trust Him to be their Savior.  That is the only way God could keep His holy expectations and save us from being trapped in sin.

          And, we recap everything that has led to this moment.  I said at the beginning of this capsule that the Jews would go through crazy ups and downs.  Everybody is agreeing to renew their covenant with God and to follow Him. This is the process of repentance.  First, you have to realize that you cannot solve the problems that sin created.  Once you recognize God’s authority and mercy, you admit your sin, put it behind you, and make changes in your life to try not to repeat their sin.  No human can ever follow the Law perfectly because the first sin impacts every child of Adam and Eve through all generations (every single person).  We naturally sin when we are given the choice.  Only God could follow His own standard because He is perfect and not like us.  God’s biggest promise to Abraham included the promise of a Savior.  He would save the world from all the problems sin created.  Jesus would not come to earth for another 400 years, but when He did, He would change the world in a way nobody expected.
