    <div id='intro'>
      <p>Choose this capsule if you already finished Capsule 1 or if you have minor exposure to the Bible and want to refresh your knowledge.</p>
      <p>Welcome! You have probably been through Capsule 1 at this point and know the basics of my format. I have made a few changes. Due to copyright issues and for appearance, you will not find the chapters right here. I have given links to the proper chapters on BibleGateway. Also, a new section called Further Reading (or Prior Reading when it comes before the main lesson) has another passage that I would recommend you read along with each lesson. Since each lesson is a little bit longer and more involved than in Capsule 1, I would suggest completing this capsule over ten days, one lesson per day. These links go to the NIV version, but you can also use the NIrV version using the dropdown menu next to the search bar.</p>

          This is the full account of how the world <em>really</em> came into existence. Many people try to convince others that random events created the universe, but there is much evidence against that theory. (<em>The Case for a Creator</em> by Lee Strobel discusses this evidence.) In the most amazing way, God created everything by simply speaking. It is also shown that &ldquo;God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.&rdquo; (Gen. 1:27) This means that God created us to paint a picture of Him and what He is like; that is our purpose in life. There is a distinct separation between man and woman, and God created the original version of marriage in this passage. God gives control of the whole earth to the human race and blesses us. Like manager positions in large companies, we become the managers of the Earth: We take care of it even though it is not really ours. Adam and his wife, the first humans, live in complete paradise with free access to God. Their work is enjoyable and exciting since everything works together in harmony. Everything was perfect.

          So, what happened? The world around us is far from the world of Genesis 1. God gave humankind one simple rule: they cannot eat the fruit of ONE tree (out of countless other trees with perfect fruit). The forbidden fruit gives knowledge of good and evil. God knows that if they eat it, they will defy Him and do what is evil. Then, there will be consequences of pain, sickness, fear, anger, sadness, and death because <em>we are not able to control our lives better than God can</em>. He has unlimited power, control, and knowledge which He uses to rule the universe in the best way possible. We were not created to be the ruler, the &ldquo;god&rdquo; of our own life, so when we do, we mess up a lot. God&rsquo;s limit made our lives better. Still, God did not want to force us into submission and, hence, gave us the ability to make our own choices. When the serpent, controlled by evil, tries to get Adam and Eve to disobey God, they choose the path apart from God filled with evil, suffering, and death. So, begins the life of consequences we all inherit from that original sin (the act of rebellion against God) which we cannot escape. In all the darkness, one verse gives hope: &ldquo;And I will put enmity between you (the serpent) and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.&rdquo; This quote from God talking to the forces of evil that hold the serpent describes how good and evil will live in war within the human race. Evil will strike the heel, or hurt, mankind, but good will crush the head, or destroy, evil. This victory will come through a certain person, a Savior.

            <p class='descrip'>
          Abram, later known as Abraham, has left his comfortable home and followed God into the wilderness (see Prior Reading). Now, God is promising Abram a son and countless grandchildren even though he is childless and old. Regardless, &ldquo;Abram believed the Lord.&rdquo; (vs. 6) When God tells Abram that his ancestors will take over the land that he now wanders through, Abram asks for confirmation. The scene that comes next seems odd and irrelevant but is really a traditional way of making serious, life-or-death promises. However, both sides making the agreement would normally pass through the carcasses together. In this case, only the firepot, standing for God, does so. God is showing, even if Abram is not perfectly faithful to God, He will still keep His promise. Throughout the Bible, the children who inherit this promise will reject God by worshipping fake statues as gods, blatantly ignoring God&rsquo;s commands, following His commands only when they are convenient, considering stuff or pleasure more important than God, and killing God&rsquo;s only Son. God still wants to have a loving relationship with every person regardless of what they do against Him.

            <h4 class='lessonhead'>Exodus 20</h4>

            <p class='descrip'>
          God follows up on His promises, as He always does, and Abraham&rsquo;s descendants grow into a huge nation known as the Israelites. Moses, the nation&rsquo;s leader, has gone up to a mountaintop to speak with God. God tells Moses how the Israelites can live up to His standard of living. In other words, God tells them how to be perfect. In return, God will help, protect, and bless the nation of Israel. To sum it up, God wants the people to put Him above everything and to love others as you would want to be loved. This summary is found in Matthew 22:36-40. Because the Israelites are prone to sin along with the rest of humanity, they will not be able to follow all the guidelines that God gives; they will give things of this world higher priority than God and think about themselves before others. God knows this and is willing to keep His promise even when the Israelites mess up. God&rsquo;s example of perfection is meant to show that we are sinful people. We need someone who can release us from the punishments of our sins, a life apart from God, by taking those punishments on himself. The best part is God would do just that.
            </p>
            <p class='further'><strong>Further Reading: Romans 7:7-25</strong> &ndash; The message of this passage is that the Law, referring to God’s standard of perfection, came so that the sins we commit are recognized as evil.  We would sin whether we know how to be perfect or not, but with the Law, we realize that we sin and need to be saved from our sin.</p>

          This is a prophecy that was given to the Israelites regarding the Savior that would come (from Genesis 3:15).  We, in the 21st century after Jesus, have a new perspective because Jesus came and fulfilled this prophecy.  Verses 2-3 tell that the Savior would not have an easy life and will not look special.  He will not fit in with the popular people of his culture but will be rejected.  As we go through verses 4-6, we find that he would have to suffer the punishment (i.e. death, pain, sadness) that we deserve for our sins even though he lived perfectly.  The government would declare him guilty even though he could have declared his innocence and been set free as declared in 7-10.  This is known as <em>substitutionary atonement</em> Because God keeps justice, he would not just let us into heaven without punishment for our sins.  But He loves us even as we insist on going against Him, so God would send his son to receive the punishments and pay the debts that we owe by dying as a criminal.  In this way, we would be justified, or made right and sinless, in God&rsquo;s eyes if we believe in Christ as the Savior and ask him to forgive our sins.  If you have not, now is the perfect time to accept this gift given to anyone who asks.  For guidance, go to the <a href=salvationcapsule.html>Road to Salvation Capsule</a>.  The story does not end there.  The Son of God will not be trapped by death.  No, the Savior would defeat death and would sit down in heaven again as the King of the Universe.  Those who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will join Him when He comes back.

            <p class='descrip'>
          This is a classic story that is told and retold every Christmas. But often ignored or overshadowed in holiday festivities was this critical event in history. Jesus gave up his seat in heaven and came to earth! That is, in a stable as a baby. See, Jesus did not want to deal with the famous, wealthy leaders. Instead, he came to the lowliest, the rejected, the poor, the sick, the blind, the paralyzed, the demon-possessed, and the sinners to be a light of salvation to the world trapped in its sin. He had been worshiped endlessly from before the beginning of this world but came to this earth where he would be rejected as a commoner and a criminal while living a life that none of us could, one that pleased God in every way. We see this prophesied and foreshadowed when Jesus is presented at the temple and then when he was a boy in his &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s (God&rsquo;s) house.&rdquo; He went through everything that we do, making the God-pleasing choice at each opportunity. He knows what it is like in our shoes and can &ldquo;empathize with our weaknesses.&rdquo; (Hebrews 4:15) We can be personal with Him, for He understands our problems and knows how to help us in our need.

          This chapter is part of Jesus&rsquo;s Sermon on the Mount, a speech made by Jesus that contained many of His most important teachings. One major point that Jesus drives home is that you should not do good works to seem religious or to get a good reputation because it is better to be good in God&rsquo;s eyes, who knows what you do, than in the eyes of people. By serving God and allowing Him to control your life, you store up riches in heaven which are much more valuable than anything you could gain on this earth. Any hardship or pain is worth going through if it shows the amazing glory of God to others. This is the reason that many today survive punishment by governments and any other troubles that following Jesus causes them to have. Jesus also promises that God will take care of your needs if you devote your life to Him. Verses 9 through 13 are often known as the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, for Jesus gives an outline of how you should talk with God. Prayer is simply talking with God and can be aloud or in your mind. Following this paragraph is an interpretation of the ideas from the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.

              <p><strong>&ldquo;Pray then, in this way:&rdquo;</strong> | This is the way to pray: <br>(You can use the ideas from this basic format and make them fit your situation, for this is an ideal way to talk with God)</p>
              <p><strong>&ldquo;Our Father who is in heaven&rdquo;</strong> | Dear perfect Father, <br>(God is our father, so we can approach Him as we would our dad. He is close and loves you. He wants to care for you in the best way.)</p>

              <p><strong>&ldquo;Your Kingdom come. Your will be done, On earth as it is in heaven&rdquo;</strong> | You know how the world works best, so make everything right according to your wisdom <br>(Ask God to address the evils and struggles of this world and make them right.)</p>

              <p><strong>&ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread.&rdquo;</strong> | Provide for each of our needs <br>(Ask God to give you what you need to live and thrive in a way that honors Him.)</p>
              <p><span class=uline>Verse 12:</span></p>
              <p><strong>&ldquo;And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.&rdquo;</strong> | Forgive all our sins and help us to forgive others as you command <br>(Even though your sins are all forgiven, admitting your sins to God builds your relationship with Him and suppresses regret, so you should ask for forgiveness and the ability to put your sins behind you. Moreover, ask God to prompt and strengthen you to forgive those who hurt you when doing so is the last thing you want to do.)</p>
              <p><span class=uline>Verse 13</span></p>
              <p><strong>&ldquo;And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil&rdquo;</strong> | Do not let evil overtake our minds or actions <br>(Ask God to help you reject what is not right is His eyes so you will not want to do these things) <br>
              NOTE: Some translations say &ldquo;&hellip;deliver us from the evil one.&rdquo;</strong> This refers to Satan, the enemy of God who causes evil and will be punished in the end.</p>
              <p><strong>&ldquo;[For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.]&rdquo;</strong> | Not in all copies of the Bible: You rule over everything for eternity. Indeed. <br>(Always focus on the fact that God is King and worthy of worship when praying. Amen is a word that adds finality, emphasis, and sincerity to what you said. It is often used to conclude specific prayers.)</p>

          The time has come for Jesus&rsquo;s purpose to be fulfilled. To rid us of the curse that we received in Genesis 3, Christ would have to receive the punishment of death to wash humanity of all sins before, during, and after his sacrifice. Judas, a helper of Jesus, helped the selfish leaders kill his leader for a little money. Then, Jesus resisted the temptation to save himself from the pain we deserve and represented our sins as he suffered on a cross. The cross was the tool of crucifixion, a method of absolute torture and death penalty reserved for the absolute worst of criminals. You felt searing pain of metal spikes driven through your wrists and ankles. As you bled, you had to pull up on the spikes to get in a position where you could breathe at all. Finally, when you could do no more, you suffocated to death because you could not move to breathe. Truly, Jesus did not die of his failing health on the cross. &ldquo;He gave up his spirit.&rdquo; Death did not capture Jesus in its trap. He put himself in the trap of death. For us. For you and me. When Jesus took our sins, he became the worst and only criminal and sinner of humanity, so his death eliminated our sin. Therefore, God is willing to cover our sins with Jesus&rsquo;s sacrifice if we believe that Jesus saved us from our sins and recreate us as if we had never sinned. This is spiritual rebirth: We become a new person because we love Jesus and are free from sin on our eternal record. We think, speak, and act differently than we did before. God looks at us and sees no sin. John 3:16 is the most profound statement of this. God says, &ldquo;For I so loved the world that I gave my one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.&rdquo; When we believe, we are destined for life in heaven in the end and we develop a new purpose of serving God on this earth. These rewards surpass everything you can imagine; I promise that and God promises that. You only need to accept this gift to gain its benefits. The <a href='salvationcapsule.html'>Road to Salvation Capsule</a> can help you understand how to be freed from your sins and accept God&rsquo;s gift. I suggest you go there now if you have not already.</p>

          Imagine seeing a graveyard with holes in the ground and all the people gone. Then, someone tells you that everyone had risen to life and left. You actually encounter one of the risen people and find that they are a close friend of yours. A similar scenario plays out with the two women in this chapter. They had devoted their lives to Jesus. They knew He was the Messiah, but now their amazing Savior is dead. As they approach the tomb where He lays, everything seems hopeless. But their faith is not in vain, for an angel comes and gives the great news that Jesus is alive! Conflicting feelings of fear and joy overwhelm the two women. Calmly, Jesus meets the two on their way to declare the news. With Jesus&rsquo;s guidance, his followers will come to understand all the events of their Savior&rsquo;s life over the next weeks. In his final words to these followers, Jesus gives a command those who believe in Him and His salvation: Spread the message of the way to be saved across the whole earth to every single person. Yet, once again, some deny the amazing truth for money and safety. They drag many into disbelief and hopelessness with them through their lies. To be most effective in following Jesus, we cannot be worried about stuff and being safe. Following Christ may be difficult or dangerous, but it is worth anything you must give up. Those who trust in Christ as their Savior would come to be known as Christians or Christ-followers. They band together from that point on to support each other and follow Jesus&rsquo;s final command. (They are known as the church, discussed in <a href='capsule1.html#church' >Acts 1:8-10</a> lesson from Capsule 1)

          Revelation is the account of a vision regarding what will happen at the end of time as we know it. Christ will return to the earth He left and take those who have trusted Him as their Savior away. Creation will be remade and restored to its pure state for the redeemed Christ-followers to live in. There will be no sin nor any of its consequences, and this new world will last forever. The final two chapters of the Bible describe the beauty and perfection of the eternal world. Verse 21:4 declares, &ldquo;&lsquo;He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.&rdquo; Those who did not follow Christ will be subject to eternal punishment in Hell [a.k.a. the Lake of Fire] with everything evil. Those who have rejected Jesus will be horrified at his return, but being with Him is the great hope of every Christ-follower. The Christians will rejoice as Jesus takes them away from the evil and problems of this world.

              This ends our introduction to the Bible. At this point, the truth of Jesus has been revealed to you. You have the opportunity to make the biggest decision of your life and trust Jesus to save you if you are still waiting. There is no better time than now. You do not have to make yourself worthy of Him. You just have to let Him pour out His love on you and enjoy it. Trust His love to save you from your sin! Future capsules will focus on studying the Bible in more detail and understanding its lessons, advice, ideas, and revelations about God and our own lives.
