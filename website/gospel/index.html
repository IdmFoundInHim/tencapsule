      A Capsule View of the Gospel
    </h1>
    <h2>
      To gain understanding of the Gospel and lead to salvation
    </h2>
    <div id='intro'>
      <p>
        Welcome! I am here to lead you through ten passages of Scripture that will reveal to you the basics of the gospel. &ldquo;The gospel&rdquo; is the amazing news of Jesus, the son of God. The first people were created by God but then sinned (i.e. rebelled against God) by defying the one command God gave us in the beginning. This separated us from God and sentenced us to death. Fortunately, God&rsquo;s love for us was so deep that He sent His only son to die for us and bring us back to unity with Himself. Yes, you read that correctly. God&rsquo;s Son, Jesus, gave up the wonderful world of heaven to come to the earth and die for us. This way, those who believe in Him will enjoy eternity in Heaven instead of being condemned to the lake of fire (a.k.a. hell, the real place of eternal punishment). Even if you do not understand everything yet, bear with me and keep reading the lessons. So, join me, and I pray that the Lord God will lead your heart to freedom and salvation in Christ. <br> <a href='../capsule1/'>Capsule 1</a> explains the coming and life of Jesus which is the focus of the Gospel</p>

    <div id='lessons'>
      <div class='lesson'>
        <h4 class='lessonhead'>Genesis 1:1</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.  (NLT)</h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          The moment that everything was created did not involve random chance. God intentionally put everything together. Everything He made was perfect with no death, pain, or struggles. Until we messed it up. God gave us the choice to love Him or reject Him, and we chose to run away from God. Apart from God, the world became a pain-filled place, and mankind became mortal. That is why we must be rescued. You must realize our problem, our separation from God, to understand and accept your salvation.
        </p>
        <p class='further'><strong>Further Reading: Genesis 1-3</strong> &ndash; Creation is described, then the first sin occurs and brings evil and death into our world.  A key point to note is that God’s one rule did not really restrict Adam and Eve from much of anything.  It allowed them to live in paradise without shame.<br>(In the future, these will be optional but strongly recommended.  Today’s three chapters won’t take more than twenty minutes, and they are critical to your understanding.  Please read these today.)</p>
      </div> <hr>
      <div class='lesson'>
        <h4 class='lessonhead'>Romans 3:10</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'>as it is written: There is no one righteous, not even one.  (HCSB)</h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          From the moment every person begins their life, they inherit a craving to go against God. That includes me, you, and everyone else. The first sin from Genesis 3 has corrupted the human species, so we all begin as an enemy of God. This means that we are too evil to go to heaven when we die. Anyone who thinks they are going to get into heaven by &lsquo;not being a bad person&rsquo; is wrong. We cannot get to heaven on our own. 
        </p>
        <p class='further'><strong>Further Reading: Isaiah 59 (The Message Translation)</strong> &ndash; Remember, much of the language here is symbolic and not literal, so you must read the passage with that in mind.  The vivid horror reflects our fallen world.<br>* Use the dropdown menu near the search bar on BibleGateway and select The Message.</p>
      </div> <hr>
      <div class='lesson'>
        <h4 class='lessonhead'>Romans 3:23-24</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'><sup> 23 </sup> For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.<sup> 24 </sup> They are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.  (HCSB)</h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Now, we find hope. Jesus gives grace and redemption freely! Christ&rsquo;s grace justifies us, meaning God looks at us just as if we had never sinned, and redeems us meaning we are allowed into heaven for eternity. Even though we do not follow all of God&rsquo;s standards, we are considered to be right before the Lord when we are redeemed by Him.
        </p>
        <p class='further'><strong>Further Reading: Ephesians 1:3-14</strong> &ndash; This passage gives assurance that God has chosen to pour his love and blessings on us when we follow Christ.  He has guaranteed the salvation of those who believe in Christ.</p>
      </div> <hr>
      <div class='lesson'>
        <h4 class='lessonhead'>Romans 6:23</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Death. It is one of the most influential events in anyone&rsquo;s life, and fear of death changes the how we live. To think, we started in a world where death did not exist until we gave it away in the Garden of Eden for one piece of fruit (see Gen. 3), and the world has never been the same. Jesus, however, offers a free gift. Through his death on the cross and resurrection on the third day, we can join Christ in victory over death.
        </p>
        <p class='further'><strong>Further Reading: Romans 5:12</strong> &ndash; Some insight on death and sin</p>
      </div> <hr>
      <div class='lesson'>
        <h4 class='lessonhead'>John 1:1-4, 14</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'><sup> 1 </sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<sup> 2 </sup> He was with God in the beginning.<sup> 3 </sup> Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made.<sup> 4 </sup> In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. <br><sup> 14 </sup> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Jesus, who is the Word, has quite the reputation. For one thing, He was with God since the beginning of time and all things were created through Him. He also gives life and light to all of creation. The shocking thing is that He was willing to leave the perfect world of heaven, become a human, suffer all the trouble that we do, and even die a painful death of Roman crucifixion &ndash; the torturous death of a criminal &ndash; just so we could escape the punishment of sin. He loves us that much. 
        </p>
        <p class='further'><strong>Further Reading: Matt. 26:36-44</strong> &ndash; Jesus suffers through agony over his upcoming death </p>
      </div> <hr>
      <div class='lesson'>
        <h4 class='lessonhead'>Romans 5:7-8</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'><sup> 7 </sup> For one will scarcely die for a righteous person&mdash;though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die&mdash;<sup> 8 </sup> but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.  (ESV)</h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          &ldquo;Love&rdquo; and other forms of the word (e.g. loved, loves) are used almost 700 times in the NIV Bible, and two-thirds of those mentions are in the New Testament. Why is this important? First, the Bible describes love very differently than society today would. Love, by one definition, is the choice to treat another person as if they never did anything wrong even though you know they have. Jesus showed that he loved us by living a perfect life and suffering the death that should have been ours. He sacrificed Himself even though he did not deserve it in any way. That is the true love Christ pours out.
        </p>
        <p class='further'><strong>Further Reading: 1 John 4:7-21 </strong> &ndash; 
      God&rsquo;s amazing love and what it means to us. Remember that the terms &ldquo;brothers and sisters&rdquo; and &ldquo;neighbors&rdquo; refer to everyone you meet.
      </p>
      </div> <hr>
      <div class='lesson'>
        <h4 class='lessonhead'>John 3:16</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          I must admit; I cannot beat John 3:16. This verse sums up the gospel beautifully. God loved us so much that, even though he never needed and never will need us, sent His Son to suffer and die, so we could be invited into heaven forever. This is the keystone of the Christian faith and the gateway to salvation. You need to lock down and fully believe these verses so you can truly and genuinely accept Christ.
        </p>
        <p class='further'><strong>Further Reading: John 3:1-21</strong> &ndash; Jesus&rsquo;s conversation with Nicodemus about being spiritually revived (&ldquo;born again&rdquo;). It is a complicated concept, so you may want to read it a few times. Jesus is referring to the changes that happen when you follow Him. It makes you a new person without you having to be physically reborn.
      </div> <hr>
      <div class='lesson'>
        <h4 class='lessonhead'>Acts 4:10b-12</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'>
      &hellip;It is by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified but whom God raised from the dead, that this man stands before you healed.<sup> 11 </sup> Jesus is &ldquo;&lsquo;the stone you builders rejected, which has become the cornerstone.&rsquo;<sup> 12 </sup> Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.&rdquo;
      </h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          Many people today think that heaven is given to those who are &ldquo;mostly good.&rdquo; Breaking News: that is a complete, total lie! The only way to heaven is Christ. Christ&rsquo;s death covered our sins, and His resurrection defeated death. Without these things, we would be dead people defined by our sins which certainly would not get us into heaven. So truly, Christ is the only way to be rescued from our sins, and that is why accepting Christ&rsquo;s gift is so critical.
        </p>
        <p class='further'><strong>Further Reading: Matthew 7</strong> &ndash; A collection of some of Jesus’s teachings.  Take notice of verses 13 and 14, especially.</p>
      </div> <hr>
      <div class='lesson'>
        <h4 class='lessonhead'>Romans 10:9-11,13</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'><sup> 9 </sup> If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.<sup> 10 </sup> One believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation.<sup> 11 </sup> Now the Scripture says, Everyone who believes on Him will not be put to shame…<sup> 13 </sup> For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.  (HCSB)</h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          This is the opportunity of a lifetime. No matter what has happened in your past, God still loves you. He still wants you. Understand that God wanted you so much that he died for you and that he would have died all over again even if you were the only one he was dying to save. Do you want your sins to be forgiven and erased? Do you want God to treat you as His child? Do you want to have a future in heaven? There is only one way, and this is it: Recognize and Admit that you are a sinner who does not meet God&rsquo;s standards. Believe that Jesus is God and is the Savior of the world who died in our place and was resurrected from the dead, so everyone who believes will not be condemned to death but will be raised to a new life in heaven as pure and sinless. Confess and tell the world that Christ has saved you. 
        </p>
        <p class='saved'>
          Go somewhere quiet and peaceful, talk with God, and tell him this:<br>
          <em>I know that I am a sinner. I am really sorry for my sins Lord and want your forgiveness. I believe that you died on the cross for me and rose again. I ask you now Lord Jesus, to come into my life, forgive me of my sins, take control of my life, and make me the kind of person you want me to be. I now receive you into my heart. Thank you for coming into my heart. I will follow you all the days of my life. In Your Name, I Pray&hellip;Amen.</em>
        </p>
        <p class='saved'>
          If you prayed that, I have great news.  You are eternally saved.  Now, Jesus lives in you (1 Corinthians 3:16) and you start a new life as you walk with Christ.  First, I have three suggestions:
        </p>
        <ol class='saved'>
          <li>Get a Bible if you have not already.</li>
          <li>Read at least one chapter every day</li>
          <li>Pray and speak with God for at least 5 minutes when you wake up and go to bed.</li>
        </ol> 
        <p class='saved'>
          These will help you as you learn to walk faithfully with God. My final two pieces of advice are 1) to always, always, always remember that there is nothing anyone can ever do to take away your salvation and 2) keep checking back to The Ten Capsule for more resources as you grow in your faith.
        </p>

      <div class='lesson'>
        <h4 class='lessonhead'>Acts 1:8-11 (What Now?)</h4>
        <h5 class='verse'><sup> 8 </sup> But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.&rdquo;<sup> 9 </sup> After he said this, he was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their sight.<sup> 10 </sup> They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them.<sup> 11 </sup> &ldquo;Men of Galilee,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;why do you stand here looking into the sky?  This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.&rdquo;  </h5>
        <p class='descrip'>
          This verse has at least two important points for new believers. First, verse eight is Christ&rsquo;s command to his followers when he returned to heaven. It speaks of the Holy Spirit giving power to everyone who follows Jesus. Since you have been saved by Jesus, this power and the Holy Spirit has already entered you. Now, it is your calling to spread the gospel to others so they can be saved just as you have been. You can begin doing this by talking to them and confessing your salvation story, which is your testimony, to your friends and family. You would not want them to miss the gift of salvation. It is also important to join a church (See Capsule 1, <a href='capsule1.html#church'>Acts 1:8-10 &ndash; Commission</a>) to become more comfortable talking about your faith and immersing yourself in a Christ-centered environment. The second point I would like to mention is Christ&rsquo;s second coming, mentioned in verse 11. Christ will return to the earth to wipe out sin, death, and Satan (the enemy of God) forever. In doing so His just and perfect wrath against unbelievers will be poured out, and those who are not saved will be condemned to Hell and eternal punishment. As a saved believer who has accepted Christ, you are excluded from this wrath. You and I will get to live forever in the wonderful world of heaven in the presence of God that will surpass anything this world will ever be.
        </p>
        <p id='end'>Imagine that. Until then, continue to grow in your relationship with Christ. Live all in for Him and amass your eternal rewards in heaven (Ephesians 6:8).
