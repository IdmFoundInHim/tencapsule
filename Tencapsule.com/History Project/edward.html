            <span class="inthead">An interview with Edward I, King of England from 1272 to his death:</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            <span class="inthead">Interviewer:</span> &ldquo;Hello, I&rsquo;d like to start by thanking you for all you&rsquo;ve done for England. Can you tell us some of the secrets to your success?&rdquo;<br />
            <span class="inthead">Edward I:</span> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been able to use my experience as a soldier to improve the military forces of our country. Through much perseverance, England has conquered Wales. Simply, you just shouldn&rsquo;t take no for an answer.&rdquo;<br />
            <span class="inthead">Int.:</span> &ldquo;Speaking of perseverance, it has been said you previously &lsquo;forgot danger when [you] wanted revenge.&rsquo; You are known to be the greatest monarch of your time, but your attack on the church clergy has brought up questions about how great you are&hellip;&rdquo;<br />
            <span class="inthead">Ed. I:</span> &ldquo;I admit that I made a poor decision rooted in anger and my temper, but I was forced to take some political power away from the church to keep order and update the English law.&rdquo;<br />
            <span class="inthead">Int.:</span> &ldquo;Another point, how do you manage this whole country as well as you do?&rdquo;<br />
            <span class="inthead">Ed. I:</span> &ldquo;I make decisions efficiently and quickly, then let my assistants take care of details.&rdquo;<br />
            <span class="inthead">Int.:</span> &ldquo;Has the pressure put upon those assistants been a problem?&rdquo;<br />
            <span class="inthead">Ed. I:</span> &ldquo;They work hard and have been very reliable to this point.&rdquo;<br />
            <span class="inthead">Int.:</span> &ldquo;That brings us to the end of our time. Thank you.&rdquo;
