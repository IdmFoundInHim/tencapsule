        <p>Around our town of Clarenton, you will see many activities like badminton, chess, other board games, card games, and dancing. During various feasts, the town hosts shows with bears combatting our trained, ferocious dogs. Clarenton has expert waits &#40;hired musicians&#41; to make music for the town. Also, troubadours and minstrels will entertain you with music and poetry as they pass through our area. Finally, our guilds perform Bible stories in special presentations. Many days off work are granted, so you'll have plenty of time to enjoy the recreational services</p>
