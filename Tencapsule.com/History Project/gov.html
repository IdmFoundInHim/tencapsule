        <p>Unlike many towns around us, we in Clarenton can boast a royal charter and organized city council. Many great merchants roam our streets, and merchant guilds are your gateway to endless wealth! If a life of trading and selling isn&apos;t for you, join one of our various craft guilds and support our city's commerce as a shopkeeper. Our streets are kept safe and orderly by the royal courts and guilds who handle crimes and business complaints, respectively. Always, anyone who comes to our town and stays for a year and a day is officially free.</p>
