        <div id='intro'>
            <p>The Ten Capsule is a program that guides you through the main points of the Bible. If you have little or no earlier experience with the Bible, <a href='http://www.biblica.com/en-us/bible/bible-faqs/what-is-the-bible/'>click here</a> for an explanation of what the Bible is and why it is important. In other words, it gives a &ldquo;capsule view&rdquo; of the Bible&rsquo;s message. You will read ten sections of the Bible and an interpretation of the passage in each &ldquo;capsule&rdquo; which is a set of lessons. You can always work through the capsules on your own time.</p>
            <p>Before you begin, I recommend you have a physical Bible with you or that you can access a Bible website like <a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/'>BibleGateway</a>. Certain capsules will have the Bible excerpt on the webpage. In that case, the verses may be in many different versions due to copyright requirements. I recommend the NIV or NIrV for readability. <!--The concept of different versions/translations of the Bible is explained here.--></p>
            <p>My disclaimer is this: The Bible is written by God and every chapter, verse, word, and letter is important. These capsules could never explain every point in the Bible. These capsules help you to understand the Bible&rsquo;s main purpose: to tell the world about how God deeply loves us.</p>

                <p>Choose this capsule if you have had no or almost no exposure to the Bible and are not at all familiar with basic Bible concepts and stories.  This capsule will give a preview and very basic platform to build more Bible/Gospel knowledge on.  There is no recommended timeframe for this capsule since the passages are short.</p>

                <p>Choose this capsule if you already finished Capsule 1 or if you have minor exposure to the Bible and want to refresh your knowledge.  This capsule will expand on the concepts from the first capsule.  Estimated timeframe: 10 days</p>
